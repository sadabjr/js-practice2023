loremiExplanation:

- The `readFileContents` function takes two arguments: the path to the file to be read and a callback function to handle the file contents.
- The `fs` module is required at the top of the file.
- Within the `readFileContents` function, the `readFile` method of the `fs` module is used to read the contents of the file.
- The first argument to the `readFile` method is the path to the file to be read.
- The second argument is the encoding of the file contents (in this case, `'utf8'`).
- The third argument is a callback function that will be called once the file is read. The callback takes two arguments: an error (if one occurred) and the contents of the file (if the file was read successfully).
- If an error occurs while reading the file, the callback is called with the error as the first argument.
- If the file is read successfully, the callback is called with `null` as the first argument and the contents of the file as the second argument.
- An example usage of the `readFileContents` function is shown at the bottom of the code block. The function is called with the path to a file and a callback function. If an error occurs, the error is logged to the console. If the file is read successfully, the contents of the file are logged to the console.

Note:

- This code assumes that the file being read is a text file (hence the `'utf8'` encoding argument). If you're reading a binary file (e.g. an image), you'll need to use a different encoding argument.
- This code uses a callback function to handle the file contents, but you could also use a Promise or async/await instead.
8. **Write a function to load an image asynchronously and handle the load event with a callback.**
    - Solution
        
        ```jsx
        function loadImageAsync(url, callback) {
          const img = new Image();
        
          // Set up event listener for when the image has loaded
          img.addEventListener('load', () => {
            callback(null, img);
          });
        
          // Set up event listener for when there's an error loading the image
          img.addEventListener('error', () => {
            callback(new Error(`Failed to load image at ${url}`));
          });
        
          // Start loading the image
          img.src = url;
        }
        
        // Example usage:
        loadImageAsync('https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/v1312461204/sample.jpg', (error, img) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(error);
          } else {
            // Add the loaded image to the page
            document.body.appendChild(img);
          }
        });
        ```
        
        Explanation:
        
        - The `loadImageAsync` function takes two arguments: the URL of the image to load, and a callback function to handle the result.
        - Inside the function, we create a new `Image` object, which we'll use to load the image.
        - We set up event listeners for the `load` and `error` events of the image object. When the image loads successfully, we call the callback function with `null` as the error argument, and the loaded image object as the second argument. If there's an error loading the image, we call the callback with an `Error` object as the first argument, and no second argument.
        - Finally, we set the `src` property of the image object to the specified URL, which starts the loading process.
        
        Note:
        
        - This function uses the HTML5 `Image` object to load the image, which is not available in Node.js. To load images in Node.js, you'll need to use a different method, such as the `image-size` or `sharp` libraries.
9. **Write a function to simulate an asynchronous delay using a callback.**
    - Solution
        
        ```jsx
        function simulateDelay(delay, callback) {
          setTimeout(callback, delay);
        }
        
        // Example usage:
        console.log("Before delay");
        
        simulateDelay(2000, () => {
          console.log("After delay");
        });
        
        console.log("Function finished executing");
        
        // Output:
        // Before delay
        // Function finished executing
        // After delay (after a 2 second delay)
        ```
        
        Explanation:
        
        - The `simulateDelay` function takes two arguments: the delay time in milliseconds and a callback function to execute after the delay has completed.
        - Inside the function, `setTimeout` is used to delay the execution of the callback function for the specified amount of time.
        - The callback function is executed once the delay has completed.
        - In the example usage, the console logs demonstrate that the function continues to execute while the delay is happening, and the callback function executes after the delay has completed.
        
        Note:
        
        - This function is a basic example of simulating an asynchronous delay using callbacks. In real-world situations, it may be more appropriate to use Promises or async/await syntax for more robust handling of asynchronous operations.
